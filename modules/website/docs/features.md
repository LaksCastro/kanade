Kanade is an apk extractor app that allows you to extract apk files from _almost_ any installed app on your Android device. Here are some of its features:

- [x] Apk extraction, I'm sure you weren't expecting it.
- [x] Batch/multiple apk extraction.
- [x] List and search device installed apps (plus internal packages).
- [x] No ads or tracking, this app doesn't even has `INTERNET` permission.
- [x] No `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission.
- [x] Customizable behavior.
- [x] Dark and light theme.
- [x] List extracted apks files inside the app.
- [x] Uninstall apps.
- [x] Install apks.
- [x] Share apks.

Missing, sorted by priority:

- [ ] Support for installing app bundle (A).
- [ ] Analyze apk metainfo (name, version, package, etc.) (B).
- [ ] Sign-in apk (C).

Keep in mind that this is not a file manager. I have plans to make it a "file explorer"-like app in the future, but for now, the main feature is just to extract apks.
